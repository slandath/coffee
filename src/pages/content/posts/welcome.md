description: An introduction to the site

Hello and welcome to my coffee site! Let's discuss the Three W's:

## Who?

My name is Tom! I'm a project manager, web developer and coffee enjoyer.

## What?

This is my coffee site! This will be my online repository for:

- Coffee brands I enjoy
- Coffee shops I've visited
- Coffee equipment and gadgets I use
- Coffee-related resources I stumble across

A few things this site will not contain:

- Reviews
- Tasting notes
- Equipment testing

## Why?

Ah yes - the million dollar question. There are a few reasons:

- I like coffee
  - I've never worked as a barista and I do not consider myself a coffee "expert" in any way. However, I am a daily coffee drinker and I love the ritual and culture around coffee.
- Archiving
  - I've accumulated lots of coffee knowledge over the years and I'd like a place to write it all down, before it leaves my head.
- It's a fun side project
  - In web development, I'm always looking for a reason to try a new framework or start a new side project. I had a little coffee-to-water ratio calculator web app that I didn't know what to do with, so I decided to expand it, and here we are!

## Thank you!

Thank you for stopping by! Take care!
